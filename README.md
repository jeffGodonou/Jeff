Jeff

Jeff is a little chatbot of my conception powered by Rasa. It's a little test on my learning of chat bot using nlu to learn pattern.
The chat will act as a little assistant on small task like giving the weather, holding a planner, helping in search of some information.
My scope of actions is not well defined yet based on the fact that this is a test and a learning exercise.

I am hoping to train some of the behaviors on some interactions I had on differents social network and in real life discussion I had. 
It's solely trained on my private data and made up stories I have created based like implied up with different experiences I had in the past.
